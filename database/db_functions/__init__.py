"""
This folder is  responsible for holding the functions
to a certain model.

Each model gets it's own corensponding named file so user_models -> user_functions

Each file has its own scope if functions related
to the parent model and that model alone. This is so
as to make it easier to know what functions are running at impoort,

Please give each a short but decreptive name on what it does but most functions will be
create_*
update_*
delete_*
get_*_by_id

please only do db opreations there and nothing else
