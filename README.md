## Project Structure

Below is a summary of the main files and folders in this repository (excluding `.pyc` caches and the `env` folder):

```
/Campaign_manager_backend/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ requirements.txt
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ <other source files and folders>
```

> **Note:** The `env/` folder contains your virtual environment and is excluded from version control. `.pyc` files are also ignored.

## Dependencies

All Python dependencies are listed in `requirements.txt`. To install them, run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository.
2. Set up your Python environment.
3. Install dependencies from `requirements.txt`.
4. Create a `.env` file.

> **Note:** This is where you configure the variable for `ALLOWED_ORIGIN` for handling **CORS**:

```
ALLOWED_ORIGIN=http://localhost:5173
```

## Running the Application

After installing the dependencies, you can run the application using:

```bash
python -m fastapi dev ./app/main.py
```

## Contributing

üöÄ **Contribution Workflow**

This project uses a **stable `main`, integration `dev`, and personal developer branch workflow** for contributions:

‚úÖ **Branch Workflow:**

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Branch off `dev` using your name:**

```bash
git checkout dev
git pull
git checkout -b <your-name>/dev
git push -u origin <your-name>/dev
```

2Ô∏è‚É£ **Create features off your personal branch:**

```bash
git checkout <your-name>/dev
git checkout -b feature/<feature-name>
# work, commit, push regularly
```

3Ô∏è‚É£ **Merge your feature branch into your personal branch:**

```bash
git checkout <your-name>/dev
git merge feature/<feature-name>
git push
```

4Ô∏è‚É£ **Keep your personal branch updated with `dev`:**

```bash
git checkout <your-name>/dev
git pull origin dev
git push
```

5Ô∏è‚É£ **When your work is ready, open a Pull Request from your personal branch to `dev`.**

6Ô∏è‚É£ After team review and testing, `dev` is periodically merged into `main` for releases.

‚úÖ **Best Practices:**

* Write clear, meaningful commit messages (e.g., `feat: add JWT middleware`, `fix: handle token expiry`).
* Ensure tests and lint checks pass before opening a PR.
* Request a code review before merging.
* Use feature flags for incomplete work if needed.
